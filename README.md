Warning this code is for python 3.x

Chapter 3
- primes - calculates the first thousand primes and finds the longest sequence of non-primes

Chapter 4
- decay - calculates the exponential decay of Bromine numerically using the Euler method and the Runge-Kutta method to the 4th order and finds the error in the numerical values with respect tot the analytical values

Chapter 5
- particle1dim - uses the Adam-Bash method to calculate the position, momentum and energies of a 1 dimensional particle moving towards a potential

Chapter 6
- hspec - calculates the descrete energy eigenstates of the Lennard-Jones potential via the action integral
- morse - calculates the descrete energy eigenstates of the Morse potential via the action integral

Chapter 7 
- electrostat - calculates the potential according to $L_{ap}(V) = 0$ numerically using the Gauss-Siedel method and compares it with the analytical solution

Chapter 8
- randomnumber - generate random numbers using the flat distribution and gaussian distributions, it also finds the average and standard deviation
- mcintegrate - calculates pi using the monte-carlo integration method it also calculates the integral of a gaussian function with a standard deviation of 1 and top at x = 0 using the monte-carlo method
- randomwalk - finds the paths of a dunken student, a particle in a box the average distance to (0,0) of 100 steps with/without a random stepsize, a wall, interaction between the particles
- traffic - in this program a traffic situation of N cars over M section is made. The average speed per car per step and the average traffic-jam speed per car per step is calulated

Chapter 9
- scatter - calculates the paths and energies of particles using the rutherford scattering idea and using 2 moving particles it also uses the electrodynamic forces to find the path of 10 particles in	3D, as well as the path of the inner planets in the solar system using the gravitational forces

Chapter 10
- Free - simulates a quantum wave particle crossing a square potential of $V_{0}$ with energy $E$ (> $V_{0}$), it calculates $\left|\psi(x,t)\right|^2$ for about 10s
